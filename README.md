# ECS102-Final-Project
Must make four input files (one for each category), with the questions and answers formatted exactly as they are in the sample input file.

Each of the four category files is a category in the game, containing all of the questions and answers for that category. (Do not edit anything about the formatting of these files, but you can change the questions and answers if you want!)

The game goes to the 1000 points (or the first person to exceed it)

The background of the main window changes color randomly every round!
